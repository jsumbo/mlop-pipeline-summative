# Diabetes Prediction System - Video Demo Script (3 minutes)

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello everyone! Today I'll be demonstrating our Diabetes Prediction System, a machine learning application that helps predict diabetes in patients based on various health metrics. The system features a user-friendly web interface, model retraining capabilities, and comprehensive data insights."

## Project Setup (30 seconds)
"Let's start by setting up the project. First, we need to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. The project uses Django for the web framework, scikit-learn for machine learning, and various other Python packages. We can also run the application using Docker for easy deployment."

[Show commands:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # or .\env\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Model Training and Evaluation (45 seconds)
"Now, let's look at our model training process. We use the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains various health metrics. The notebook shows our data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and feature scaling. Our SVM model achieves an impressive accuracy of 89% on the test set.

Let's examine the model's performance metrics:
- Accuracy: 89%
- Precision: Measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases
- Recall: Measures the model's ability to find all positive cases
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

The confusion matrix shows us the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives."

## Data Analysis and Visualizations (45 seconds)
"Our system includes comprehensive data visualizations that help us understand the relationships between different health metrics:

1. Correlation Heatmap: Shows how different features are related to each other and to the outcome
2. Feature Distributions: Histograms showing the distribution of each health metric for both diabetic and non-diabetic patients
3. Box Plots: Helps identify outliers and understand the spread of each feature
4. Feature Importance: Shows which health metrics have the strongest influence on diabetes prediction
5. ROC Curve: Demonstrates the model's ability to distinguish between classes across different thresholds"

## Web Interface (30 seconds)
"The web interface provides an intuitive way to interact with our model. Users can:
1. Make predictions by entering patient data
2. Upload new training data to retrain the model
3. View data insights and visualizations
4. Access the API endpoints for programmatic use"

## Model Retraining (30 seconds)
"One of the key features is the ability to retrain the model with new data. Users can upload a CSV file with new patient data, and the system will:
1. Preprocess the new data
2. Retrain the model
3. Update the model file
4. Show the new model's performance metrics"

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
"This completes our demonstration of the Diabetes Prediction System. The application combines machine learning with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to healthcare professionals. The system's ability to be retrained with new data ensures it can adapt to changing patient populations and medical knowledge."
